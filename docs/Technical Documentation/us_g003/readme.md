*As a Project Manager, I want the team to configure the project structure, utilizing GitHub, Maven, and specified project directories, to facilitate/accelerate the development of upcoming user stories.*

## 1. Context

This task is aimed at configuring the project structure to enhance the efficiency and speed of upcoming development tasks, utilizing GitHub for version control and Maven for managing dependencies. It is essential for streamlining the development process and ensuring that the team can work effectively on upcoming user stories.

## 2. Requirements

In this section, we aim to establish the requirements for configuring the project structure to meet the Project Manager's request.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- G003.1. The project structure should be organized logically to accommodate the development of various user stories efficiently.
- G003.2. The configuration should include clear guidelines and standards for naming conventions, directory structure, and file organization, utilizing GitHub for version control.
- G003.3. The project structure should leverage Maven for managing dependencies, ensuring efficient dependency resolution and build processes.
- G003.4. The project structure should support scalability, allowing for easy integration of new features and functionalities.
- G003.5. The configured project structure should be documented comprehensively for future reference and onboarding of new team members.

**Dependencies/References:**
*This requirement is essential for the successful execution of upcoming user stories and aligns with the project's goal of improving development efficiency.*

## 3. Analysis

The team initially reviewed the provided project structure and identified areas for improvement to better align with the Project Manager's request. This analysis included evaluating the existing development practices, identifying potential bottlenecks, and considering industry best practices for project structuring.

## 4. Design

### 4.1. Realization

Based on the analysis of the initial project structure, the team decided to organize it into modules or components, each responsible for specific functionalities or features. This modular approach aimed to enhance code maintainability and scalability, addressing the identified areas for improvement.

### 4.2. Class Diagram

N/A

### 4.3. Applied Patterns

The team applied the modular design pattern to ensure that the project structure remained flexible and adaptable to future changes and additions. This involved restructuring existing components and introducing new ones as necessary.

### 4.4. Tests

N/A

## 5. Implementation

The team proceeded with implementing the configured project structure, incorporating the necessary changes based on the design specifications and the identified areas for improvement. GitHub was utilized for version control, and Maven was employed for managing dependencies. The implementation process involved restructuring the existing codebase, updating configuration files, and documenting the changes made.

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

The integration of the configured project structure was demonstrated by showcasing its ability to support the development of upcoming user stories seamlessly. This involved running tests, ensuring code consistency, and verifying adherence to established guidelines.
## 7. Observations

It is crucial to regularly review and update the project structure to accommodate evolving project requirements and technological advancements. Additionally, documentation of the project structure should be maintained and kept up-to-date to aid in knowledge transfer and onboarding of new team members.

The project includes directories such as:

- **docs**: Contains documentation related to the project, including the glossary, sprint documents with descriptions of sprint user stories and individual README files for each team member.

- **jobs4u.app.backoffice**: Contains code related to the back office functionality of the "Jobs4U" application. This may include administrative features, data management, and backend services specifically for managing the back office operations.

- **jobs4u.app.candidate**: Contains code related to the candidate-facing functionality of the "Jobs4U" application. This may include features for job searching, application submission, and candidate profile management.

- **jobs4u.app.customer**: Contains code related to the customer-facing functionality of the "Jobs4U" application. This may include features for employers to post job listings, manage applications, and interact with candidates.

- **Scripts**: Contains scripts for building, testing, and running the application. These scripts should be documented and easily accessible to facilitate development and deployment processes.

This user story emphasizes the importance of a well-organized project structure in facilitating efficient and accelerated development of future user stories, with each directory serving a specific purpose within the project.
