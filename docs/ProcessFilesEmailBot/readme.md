# US 2001 - As Product Owner, I want the system to continuously process the files produced by the Applications Email Bot, so that they can be imported into the system by initiative of the Operator. #

## 1. Context

This task involves enhancing the system's capability to process files generated by the Applications Email Bot. It is a new feature to be developed to automate the import process of job applications into the system.

## 2. Requirements

**US 2001:**
As a Product Owner, I want the system to continuously process the files produced by the Applications Email Bot, so that they can be imported into the system by initiative of the Operator.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system continuously monitors for new files produced by the Applications Email Bot.
- Files are copied to a shared folder for import into the system.
- Duplicate files are detected and handled appropriately to maintain system consistency.
- The report generated by the Application File Bot contains sufficient information for diagnosing import issues.
- The report is created periodically, with the frequency configurable via a configuration file.
- There is no specified limit on the number of files allowed as attachments, but the system should support configuration for size or number limits.

**Dependencies/References:**

This requirement is related to the following user stories:
- US2001: Continuous processing of files produced by the Applications Email Bot.

## 3. Analysis

During the analysis phase, the team will study the behavior of the Applications Email Bot and assess its file production process. Consideration will be given to the following aspects:
- Understanding the format and structure of files produced by the Applications Email Bot.
- Identifying potential challenges in file processing, such as handling duplicate files and ensuring system consistency.
- Exploring strategies for continuous monitoring of the file system to detect new files.
- Analyzing the content and structure of the report generated by the Application File Bot to determine the information required for diagnosing import issues.

## 4. Design

### 4.1. Realization

The realization involves implementing the functionality to continuously process files produced by the Applications Email Bot. This includes developing a file monitoring mechanism to check for new files, copying new files to a shared folder, handling duplicate files, and generating reports from the Application File Bot's output. The backend system will manage these processes without requiring changes to the user interface. Configuration options may be provided for parameters such as file monitoring frequency and shared folder location.

```
public class ApplicationFileProcessingTest {

    @Test
    public void testContinuousFileMonitoring() {
        // Test if the system continuously monitors for new files
        // Create a mock file and check if it's detected by the monitoring system
        // Assert that the file is detected and processed
    }

    @Test
    public void testFileCopying() {
        // Test if files are copied to the shared folder for import
        // Simulate the creation of a file and check if it's copied to the designated folder
        // Assert that the file is successfully copied without errors
    }

    @Test
    public void testDuplicateFileHandling() {
        // Test if duplicate files are handled appropriately
        // Create two identical files and attempt to copy them to the shared folder
        // Assert that only one instance of the file is retained and the duplicate is discarded
    }

    @Test
    public void testReportGeneration() {
        // Test if the report generated by the Application File Bot contains sufficient information
        // Generate a sample report and validate its contents against expected diagnostic information
        // Assert that the report contains the required details for diagnosing import issues
    }

    @Test
    public void testReportFrequencyConfiguration() {
        // Test if the report generation frequency is configurable via a configuration file
        // Modify the report generation frequency in the configuration file and verify the change takes effect
        // Assert that the report is generated with the updated frequency as configured
    }

    @Test
    public void testAttachmentLimits() {
        // Test if the system supports configuration for size or number limits of attachments
        // Attempt to import files exceeding the configured size or number limits
        // Assert that the system rejects files exceeding the specified limits
    }
}

## 5. Implementation

The implementation phase will involve the following steps:
- Developing a file monitoring mechanism to continuously check for new files produced by the Applications Email Bot.
- Implementing logic for copying files to a shared folder designated for import into the system.
- Designing algorithms to detect and handle duplicate files to maintain system consistency.
- Creating a report generation module to extract relevant information from the Application File Bot's report and format it appropriately for diagnosis purposes.

Code commits will be made to the repository to track progress and ensure alignment with the design.

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

Integration efforts will focus on seamlessly integrating the file processing functionality with existing components of the system, such as the import module. The demonstration will showcase the following:
- Continuous monitoring and processing of files produced by the Applications Email Bot.
- Proper handling of duplicate files to maintain system consistency.
- Generation of reports containing diagnostic information for import issues.
- Configuration of the report generation frequency via a configuration file.

## 7. Observations

During development, the team will explore alternative solutions and consider third-party tools or libraries that may enhance the file processing capabilities. Critical perspectives on the design and implementation will be documented for future reference and improvement. The team will also ensure compliance with any relevant standards or regulations governing file processing and import procedures.
